## Releases
**tDRO**: [Task-level Distributionally Robust Optimization for Large Language Model-based Dense Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10613). The tDRO (task-level Distributionally Robust Optimization) algorithm for Large Language Model-based Dense Retrieval (LLM-DR) fine-tuning, targeted at improving the universal domain generalization ability by end-to-end reweighting the data distribution of each task.

**bowdpr**: [Drop your Decoder: Pre-training with Bag-of-Word Prediction for Dense Passage Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11248). Bag-of-Word Prediction is a new encoder-only pre-training schema for dense retrieval targeted at efficiency and interpretability.  (Accepted by SIGIR 2024)

**CoT-MAE-qc**: [Query-as-context Pre-training for Dense Passage Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09598). A simple yet effective pre-training scheme for single vector Dense Passage Retrieval. (Accepted by EMNLP 2023 Main Conference)

**CoT-MAE**: [ConTextual Mask Auto-Encoder for Dense Passage Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07670). CoT-MAE is a transformers based Mask Auto-Encoder pre-training architecture designed for Dense Passage Retrieval. (Accepted by AAAI 2022)
